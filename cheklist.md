## Features to Implement

### 1. **Animation Improvements**

- **New Tile Appearance:**
  Each new number tile should have an independent animation, regardless of whether a tile previously existed at that position.
- **Tile Movement Animation:**
  Smooth animations for tile movement across the grid. The speed should feel natural, neither too fast nor too slow.
- **Tile Merge Animation:**
  Add an effect for when tiles merge, such as a scaling or pulsating animation.
- **Victory Animation:**
  Implement a celebratory effect like confetti flying across the screen when the player wins.
- **Game Over Animation:**
  Add an animation to visually indicate a loss, e.g., fading out tiles or a dramatic overlay.

### 2. **Sound Effects**

- **Tile Movement Sound:**
  Play a subtle sound effect when tiles move.
- **Victory Sound:**
  Add a celebratory sound for when the player wins.
- **Game Over Sound:**
  Include a distinct sound for when the player loses.

### 3. **Logic and UI Enhancements**

- **Winning and Losing Logic:**
  Replace the current alerts (`confirm`) with a modal overlay.

  - Modal should display:
    - For victory: "Your final score is..." with buttons for _Continue Playing_ or _Restart_.
    - For loss: "Game Over. Your final score is..." with a _Restart_ button.
  - Other elements on the page should become inaccessible when the modal is active.

- **Input Behavior Fixes:**
  - Prevent page scrolling when using arrow keys for gameplay.
  - Option 1: Add a _Pause_ button that allows arrow key functionality outside of gameplay.
  - Option 2: Adapt the layout so the game fits perfectly within the viewport, eliminating the need for page scrolling.

### 4. **Swipe Support**

- Add swipe gestures for gameplay, making the game mobile-friendly. Swiping in a direction should trigger the same logic as arrow key presses.

### 5. **Responsive Design**

- Implement a fully responsive layout that scales the game grid and elements based on the screen size, ensuring optimal usability across devices.
